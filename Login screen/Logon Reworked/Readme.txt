For Windows 7 X64, 64bits:
--------------------------
in "System32" you have the x64 files ---> main x64 system files
in "SysWOW64" you have the x86 files ---> dependencies for the 32bit processes running on your Windows x64.

So you should download the x64 link, and replace the files manually in the "System32" folder. If you are runnig the x64 version of Windows 7.

For Windows 7 X86, 32bits:
--------------------------
If you run the x86-32bit, download from the x86 link and replace in "System32" also.

That is IT!

Don't forget to take ownership(Search with Google for that, it's a *.reg file) and replace manually (also, make a darn backup, before replacing!)
